# Simulation of KZ dynamics with physical parameters

The quench in this setting ends at the CP. 

## Shape of data

Very weird.

## Quantities

The quantities we evaluate are:
- Fidelity of the state with the istantaneous GS --> *Fidelity.py*
- Density of excitations at the end of the quench (at critical point) -> KZ prediction? --> *Nex.py*
- Occupation of single modes at critical point for different quench times --> *Populations.py*
- Normalized energy of the state at the critical point as a function of quench time --> *Energy_state.py*

## Not implemented yet
- Energy of excitations as a function of time during the quench --> *compute_Enex*
- Compute entropy --> *compute_S* (NOT READY)
- Compute the correlation length by fitting the correlation function --> *compute_CL* (NOT READY)
