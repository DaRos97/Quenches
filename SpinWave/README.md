#Introduction

Here with 2sw.py we compute the GS energy of -J\sum (XX+YY) + h(staggered) using spin waves (Holstein-Primakof).

For each value of J,h we compute the GS energy for all values of theta, which defines the quantization axis.

For theta = 0 we expand in spin-waves around the AFM configuration, while for theta=pi/2 the Q-axis is along x.
